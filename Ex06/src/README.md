# Exercise 6 – Creating with WebGL
We have implemented the following bonuses:
1. Make the ball spin around itself while moving.
2. Add collectible cards with “VAR” written on them, that increase your Fair Play score
   instead of decreasing it. The attached texture should be positioned under the "textures" folder.
